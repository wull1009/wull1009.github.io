Overgrazing will lead to grassland degradation and destroy the ecological function of grassland, 
so the survey of grassland grazing livestock resources is of great significance to grassland ecological management. 
This project utilizes a UAV to take field photos and samples in Hulunbeier, 
and utilizes the convolutional convolutional neural network model in deep learning for image recognition of livestock. 
This project aims to improve the accuracy of neural network target recognition 
and promote the application of remote sensing tools in grassland grazing livestock surveys.
